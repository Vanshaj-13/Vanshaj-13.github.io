                 Avyakt is a hybrid UAV engineered by Inferno DTU for the International Planetary Aerial Systems Challenge. Designed for Mars exploration, it merges vertical takeoff capability with fixed-wing endurance, enabling payload transport, terrain mapping, and atmospheric sampling. Its adaptive structure features morphing wings, a gold-plated composite fuselage for radiation resistance, and a robust thermal control system using RHUs and graphene-based heat routing. Controlled by a PX4 + Jetson Nano stack and simulated in ROS/Gazebo, Avyakt operates autonomously across multiple flight modes, supported by solar thin-film arrays and LoRa-based communication. It represents a novel solution for interplanetary logistics and science missions.

                Developed a simulation-based autonomous drone racing system using the Crazyflie quadrotor to navigate through a complex sequence of gates while avoiding randomly placed obstacles. Implemented and benchmarked various path-planning algorithms including A*, RRT*, and Dijkstra’s, with A* combined with cubic spline smoothing selected as the final strategy for its optimal balance of speed, accuracy, and stability. The trajectory planning ensured each gate was traversed in the correct sequence with minimal overshoot and dynamically feasible flight paths. Using a hybrid of procedural waypoint generation and spline interpolation, the system achieved smooth, collision-free navigation under real-time constraints, showcasing the effectiveness of integrating graph-based planners with continuous trajectory optimization in competitive aerial robotics.

Simulations in ANSYS demonstrated that the microgel significantly increases the torque tolerance threshold before cell rupture, enhancing the safety and robustness of biological micromanipulation. Designed using SolidWorks and modeled for microfabrication via DRIE in Silicon Nitride, this system merges soft robotics and MEMS technology to enable minimally invasive, feedback-free biomedical operations.
